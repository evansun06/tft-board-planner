# My Personal Project
### About
This project will be a TFT game board planner and tracker. TFT is a strategy turn-based online video game
that relies heavily on managment and cohesion. This java application will allow users to make and save
new "boards" to reference. In a board, users can place up to twelve champions in which the application
will save. For each champion, the application will also save the desired items users may want to attactch.
Users can save and name multiple boards and track a history of how each board does in matches. The end goal
is to be able to attatch new sets (new champtions), when an update rolls out in TFT.

This project is of interest to me because TFT is one of the few games ive been able to play while away from 
home at university. The strategy is fun, and I thought making an acessible playground for users to test and 
learn would be interesting.
